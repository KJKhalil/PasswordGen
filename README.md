# PasswordGen Description
    
    This project's goal is to fill in the remaining code to create a functioning password generator. So this will be a list of all of the things I add to the code.
        -First I added a function using the variable generatePassword to create a prompt
            after you push the generate password button on the webpage. This prompt is 
            used to ask the user how many characters they want in their password which has to 
            be 8-128. I also made it so if they dont choose a number or if they choose a number
            outside of 8-128 that it will give them an alert. It will also stop the continuation of the code and prompts so they can try again at that same prompt or choose to exit it.
